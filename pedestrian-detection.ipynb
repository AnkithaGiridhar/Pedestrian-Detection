Pedestrian Detection on Videos \nThis is the final detection on videos. I tested this out on videos as well as my webcam, and this can be used for real-time pedestrian detection. Again, the upperbody lines ae commented out and are irrelevant, and the videos used have not been attached.\nThe most common error I encountered was with video_capture.read() returning None, and this was solved by cross-checking the paths of both the classifier files and the images/videos used.\nAfter a few trials, I found that the best scaling factor was 1.05 - though it made a few erroneous detections, there were more detections than scaling factors like 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. The minimum neighbours are set to 3, as a value of 4 or 5 results in fewer detections, while 1 or 2 neighbours result in many errors. The minimum size and maximum size parameters did not make any significant changes to my outputs. \nThe waitkey value impacts the speed of the video, and a smaller value would result in the video playing faster.
